I'm high above the world
Why should I feel pain
Or feel alone
To be protected like a simple boy
If I choose to let you down
Begin to know

I will fight until there's nothing left
Cross the world together from this sinking ship
Or drown alone
Off the coast
Facing nothingness
Drawn to feel the emptiness
Oh help me now
Describe the scene
